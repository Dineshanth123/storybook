          We lose people all the time. It’s just the nature of the job. What can
          you expect from a place full of nooks and crannies people
          intentionally go to get lost in? I usually don’t worry when I don’t
          see someone for a while, but when it’s been days since someone’s
          checked out, it’s usually a sign that I need to step in. I’m not doing
          this alone, thankfully. No Librarian is ever truly alone, are they? I
          have help from the Watchers and Listeners of the shelves. Thanks to
          them, it usually doesn’t take long to get the scent, if you know what
          I mean. However, today is one of the rare, and unfortunate, exceptions
          when my search has exceeded more than an hour—and an hour is pushing
          it. I’ve been searching and asking around for almost six hours,
          scouring shelves and listening for the telltale breathing. The
          Watchers have their quadrants, so it’s much like playing hot and cold.
          “Bad news.” One says, and my brain shivers in my skull, both from its
          existence and its statement. “They crossed the tape.” Says the
          Watcher, and I groan.
        </p>

        <p class="pp">
          “Are you sure?” My stomach still drops at the thought, even though
          I’ve been doing this a very long time (long enough that I remember
          every book on every shelf better than my own child’s face), but
          knowing a poor soul lost themselves beyond the tape… I grieve for
          them. The Watcher doesn’t speak, but generates an affirmative
          sensation. That means I have to backtrack to my desk for supplies. I
          thank them, asking that they send word ahead of my arrival. It’s been
          a while since I’ve had to go past the tape, which means it’s been a
          while since I entered the broom closet. The helmet is dusty (it looks
          almost like it’s from one of those old-fashioned scuba diving suits.
          It’s not nearly so heavy, though.) There’s a bright lamp affixed to
          the front just above the visor, but it’s as much of a hindrance as a
          help. While, most of the time, those beyond the tape know not to
          bother me, some still get bored enough to try—and the lamp acts like a
          beacon. I don’t blame them, it’s what prisoners do. Find the weakest
          among them and test their mettle.

          I’ve got a sack full of non-perishables, tinctures, aspirin, and a
          compass (not like the kind you’re used to, but would take too long to
          explain—and time is of the essence, so I’ll let your imagination
          handle it from here.) I sling the sack across my body, and fasten my
          waist with a utility belt that would make a trust fund bat character
          with abandonment issues jealous. It’s got floss, lighters, matches,
          and a few more tools that don’t exist outside of The Library. The last
          thing I grab is the flamethrower. This is where I should be very
          transparent with you. I’m not actually the Librarian. I’m the
          Librarian’s Assistant. I know, isn’t that just your luck, right? Not
          to worry, I’m very good at using this thing, and it does the job
          nicely—whatever job I may deem necessary at any particular moment. But
          the Head Librarian doesn’t really need much of anything to ward off
          what lingers here.I don’t know exactly where he is at the moment, nor
          do I want to know. If this were a real pickle I would summon him, but
          while a rare occasion, it’s not unusual in the scope of a thousand
          years. After all, no one comes here without the intention (whether
          it’s conscious or subconscious) to get lost.

          It’s the nature of this place. But you know that, don’t you? It’s why
          you’re here, after all. It doesn’t take me long to find the tape,
          which is fortuitous. Sometimes it moves around, but the Watchers and
          Listeners kept a beat on it this time so as to direct me. Yes, it is
          really dark.Yes, it’s literal tape. Hazard tape, but that’s almost
          like a beacon to the adventurous, isn’t it? I think The Library knows
          that. It’s greedy, but it’s also quite discerning in taste. In some
          circles that means that I should extend congratulations to you… in
          others, I offer my sincerest sympathy. I hear my name and ignore it as
          I crawl through the crisscross of reflective strips. The tape moves
          not at random, by the way. It genuinely serves as a warning. Whether
          it’s gatekeeping sections currently under construction, in repair, or
          missing. I try not to, but I think that last one has something to do
          with where the Head Librarian went. Don’t worry about it, my name is
          not important. So ineffectual that I’ve forgotten.

      <div class="box6">
        <p class="pp">
          I hear my name again as I begrudgingly turn on the lamp. Not a lot of
          help, just enough light to ensure I don’t trip over anything, or
          disturb the shelves. Many sleep here. I send off a warning shot from
          the flamethrower. Showing I carry more light than just atop my
          appetizing head. The flash of flames sends things… slithering. But
          most of those this close to the tape have never been very convicted by
          nature, so I’m not concerned. There are more Listeners and less
          Watchers past the tape, for obvious reasons. Thankfully, they say I
          don’t have to go too far. I look down at the telling clicking sound to
          see rocks rolling. Some as big as my foot, and some as small as the
          tip of my thumb. The smaller ones move more easily, but all are
          rolling as if pulled toward a central point. I don’t even need the
          compass, but I glance down at it one more time before stuffing it back
          into the sack. While I don’t have to go too far, things are… relative
          here. Ten steps may be ten thousand. And so even after only a few
          moments of exploring, I feel acute pressure jamming into my temples.
          My heart feels like it’s being squeezed, and my vision blurs. My
          fingers tingle by the time I’m able to shake the aspirin into my
          mouth.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box7">
        <p class="pp">
          I chew it, ignoring the sound of my name—my true name. The one only I
          can hear. You’ll hear your own as well, if you stay here long enough.
          My vision clears, which just means the dark looks sharper, and I sweep
          another warning arc from the flame thrower for good measure.I do this
          as much because I love the sound as for protection. I also appreciate
          the warmth. It gets cold here. But in a strange way, which shouldn’t
          surprise you at this point. It’s cold like how the first signs of
          spring show in the early morning dew that’s only just melted. I can
          smell and taste the sweat on my upper lip. And it’s cold. And then I
          hear it. A few or a thousand steps later. The breathing sound I’ve
          been listening for.The pace of the rocks quickens, and my head is
          turned down so the helmet light prevents me from tripping over—or
          impeding—their journey. A famous author once said “All things serve
          the beam”, and that’s as true in this world as it is in the others.
          Except this beam—this beacon—is attached to our lost visitor. I can
          only hear the rocks, mumblings, and the breathing sound now. The smell
          is so musty and thick. Like the air is full of sweat and dust. Like
          I’ve stuck my head out the window during a heavily falling rain. If I
          think hard enough about it, soon I’ll be drenched.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box8">
        <p class="pp">
          So, I don’t. While the rocks are almost the perfect tell, and the
          Listeners’ too corroborates the evidence, you can never be too sure.
          Only light can be sure. I take a match from the tiny box, snap it to
          life, and then blow it out. Tiny smoke tendrils curl and waft until
          they also follow the same flow as the rocks. Excellent, we’ve not been
          led astray. A few or a thousand more steps, and the rocks are
          gathering down an aisle where the breathing is more like wheezing—like
          the desperate struggle to take in. Lo and behold, we found them! Poor
          thing, judging by the state of her, she got lost early. She’s likely
          been here for most of the day. The book covers her face—consuming her
          head like a kid on a particularly large popsicle. The pages flutter
          gently against her too-white jaw. The papery quality of her skin, and
          the wanting muscle mass, show how little time was on our side—not a
          moment to waste. I grab the book by the edges of both back and front
          covers, it’s got most of her head inside at this point, just her
          earlobes, hair, and edge of her jaw peak out from beneath the pages I
          now grip firmly. The wheezing turns into a moan that turns into a sob.
          “Now, now.” I say, and test the hold the book has on its victim. It’s
          snug, too snug to yank like a leech.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box9">
        <p class="pp">
          I need to treat it like a tick, making sure to get the head out. None
          of these are intended as puns, but it just happens after being
          surrounded by books and pros for so long.I draw one of the tiny viles
          strapped in my utility belt and pull the cork out. It smells like
          nothing to me, but I see the reaction immediately. Our half-consumed
          explorer moves a bit, her fingers mostly, and I hear a second, tinier
          moan beneath that of the book’s. I pour a small amount of the
          substance into the palm of my hand, and I smooth it gently down the
          spine of the book. It wails again, and so does the girl, both full of
          sorrow and reluctance. I feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand
          up, so I turn at the hip, cock the flamethrower, and send off a very
          intentionally long tail of flames. When the feeling subsides, I shrug
          the weapon back over my shoulder. I use the backs of two knuckles to
          knock gently on the book cover, “It’s time to come back now. My
          apologies.” I say, and I mean it. The book and the girl moan again,
          more hollowly, and I can feel the seal—the bond—splitting like a seam.
          I grip the book again, because these two are stubborn, and have to pry
          them apart.
        </p>

      <div class="box10">
        <p class="pp">
          The color and mass return beneath her skin, and though her eyes are
          open, they can’t see anything. She’ll be like that for a while, it’s
          normal. She’ll recover.I pour the remaining contents of the bottle
          down the part of her frazzled blond hair. Tears fill the empty eyes
          and drip down her face. Her mouth presses into a thin white line and
          grimaces so intensely that the flesh folds in multiple layers at the
          corners of her mouth. Great pain. Even after a thousand years I still
          can’t help but feel sorry, so I pull her burning head under my chin,
          and rub circles into her back. “I’m sorry, dear. I know you’ve been
          told otherwise, but this place is a prison, and that isn’t your story.
          Yours is still being written, and the one which made you pretty
          promises is lying and jealous.“One day you, if the world is cruel, may
          yet have a place here. But it’s not today. So let’s go have a cup of
          tea.” I tell her, as I’ve told many like her. I’ve gotten better at it
          over the years. I used to have to fight with them. Often I’d give up
          and just keep them safe until the Head Librarian got back to talk them
          down.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box11">
        <p class="pp">
          She finally lets out a weak, wheezing breath. I take advantage of the
          broken seam of her lips and pour a tincture down her throat. I don’t
          even have to look anymore, I can just feel the specific melodies that
          make each tincture different. It helps that the one I need usually
          sings a bit louder as a courtesy, and it’ll purr like a cat when I’ve
          touched my fingers to it. She chokes a bit, but her eyes start to
          clear. Good enough for now. The back of my neck has another sudden
          influx of goosebumps. We’ve overstayed our welcome. It’s time to go. I
          put the book back on the shelf. I don’t scold it, just allow its ache
          and frustration flow through me. I apologize, but there’s no comfort I
          can give. My words and compassion are meaningless. I’ve noted the
          volume and will tell the Head Librarian, they might be able to soothe
          it back to sleep. I tap the metal bauble around my neck, and we’re
          back at my desk.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="box12">
        <p class="pp">
          I drape the girl onto a nearby loveseat that’s seen better days,
          starting the kettle before heading to the broom closet to stash the
          emergency kit. She’ll be fine. People like her (and you) always are.
          This place was made to help the wanderers and recklessly imaginative.
          Those who can’t wrap their heads around the world the way it is, and
          can see the truth of magic between heartbeats and heartbreaks. And
          people like me, and the Head Librarian (when they so choose to grace
          us with their presence), keep the place orderly and open for you… and
          we’re here to help guide you back on track if you lose inspiration for
          your own story. It’s the nature of the job—The Library itself. What
          else can you expect from a place full of nooks and crannies that
          people choose to get lost in?
